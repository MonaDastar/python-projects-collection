# Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the Web Scraping and Data Analysis project! This project involves creating scripts for web scraping and performing data analysis on the collected data.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to help you learn and practice web scraping techniques and data analysis using Python. The scripts provided in this repository focus on extracting data from the [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/) website, a fictional bookstore website created for learning purposes.

## How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-scraping-and-data-analysis.git
cd web-scraping-and-data-analysis
```


### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment


```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies


```
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
```

### 4. Explore the Project


```
cd Web_Scraping_and_Data_Analysis
```

### 5. Update URL in the Script

Change the url variable in scrape_books.py to the Books to Scrape website:


```
url = 'http://books.toscrape.com/'
```

### 6. Run the Script


```
python scrape_books.py
```

### 7. Review the Output

Check the generated CSV file (book_data.csv). It should now contain data about the books from the Books to Scrape website.
